Documentation
=============

We'd love your help to make this documentation better.

All documentation is written using Sphinx and checked in to one of two places:

* **Per-project docs:** Most individual Git projects have a top-level ``docs/``
  directory with the master guide for that project.
* **Miscellaneous docs:** Things that don't naturally fit into any one project,
  such as this document and the `getting started guide
  </docs/getting-started/>`_, are checked in to the `docs project
  <https://github.com/Kegbot/kegbot-docs>`_.

Whether it's a small correction or a larger improvement, you can submit doc
changes to us just as you would a code change.  See :ref:`pull-request`.
