Kegboard Build Guide Overview
=============================

Building your own board can be a very fun and rewarding project.

Preparation
===========

Time
----

Assembling a Kegboard can be done in a few hours.  If you have never soldered
before, we recommend practicing with a simpler project first.

Tools
-----

There are a few tools that are essential for assembly of your new Kegboard.
Many of these tools are available at places like Radio Shack or DIY electronics
stores.

*  Soldering iron (small screw driver or wedge shaped soldering iron tip)
*  Solder (67/37 water soluble resin-core solder 0.031")
*  Brass sponge soldering iron tip cleaner
*  Desoldering tool/braid
*  Wire cutter/stripper
*  Flush/diagonal cutter
*  Needle-nose pliers
*  Multimeter
*  Vise or third-hand holder
*  Good light *(more important than you think)*

If you don't have these items, now might be a good time to borrow or purchase
them.  They are very handy whenever assembling/fixing/modifying all electronic
devices!
